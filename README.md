<p>What is a hero to you? A hero to me is someone who is willing to risk it all for the safety of others and to do what is right.</p>
<p>One of the heros I admire the most has these following characteristics.</p>

    <ul>
      <l1>Hard work- Teddy was one of the hardest workers in his time and fought for everything.</l1>
    <p>Determination- Teddy was very determined and was even determined enough to eventually become President of the US.</p>
