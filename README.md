<p>What is a hero to you? A hero to me is someone who is willing to risk it all for the safety of others and to do what is right.</p>
<p>One of the heros I admire the most has these following characteristics.</p>

<ul>
   <li>Hard work- Teddy was one of the hardest workers in his time and fought for everything.</li>
   <li>Determination- Teddy was very determined and was even determined enough to eventually become President of the US.</li>
   <li>Friendship- Teddy was very adamant on making freinds in the oval office and liked to make new friends.</li>
   <li>Compassion- Teddy was very compassionate for his peers around him and for the people of his country.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Almost 100 years ago Teddy Roosevelt passed away. He was one of the most hard working, determined, compassionate, and one of the most caring people in the world. Teddy was president from 1901 to 1909. He was one of the most famous presidents ever in the US.</p>
